1. Initial position can be given from the .c file also. It has the dimension of nq*1.
   nq is x,y,z and a quaternion.

2. In C, if we have a const structure in a function then its data members can still be modified. In C++, you cannot. Some weird 
   black magic going on.

3. d->ctrl is used to give control input. There is no need to create a motor and postion+velocity actuator. 
   We can create a motor actuator and give the whoel PD control input in it. Or we can individually
   give the position control input and velocity control input. While giving them position and velocity control
   don't need to multiply with kp and kv as they will automatically get multplied in the simulation process.

4. Use RK4 integrator to get accurate energy measurements. In Euler, total energy decreases.

Model info can be taken from "Print model" in ./simulate. It generates a lot of things.
